Never mind that guy! Stop the goblins!”\n\n\n“But…”\n\n\nThe passage to the left I was in charge of is blocked.\n\n\nA goblin’s corpse is building a wall. It will be fine for a while.\n\n\n“Jenna, stop the bleeding on Gide’s wound.”\n\n\n“What about the goblins?”\n\n\n“I will block them.”\n\n\nran into the clearing\n\n\nThe guy next to me was about to jump off the roof. When he lifted it up and cut it, the severed head fell.\n\n\nJenna tore the sleeve of her dress with a dagger and wrapped it around Gide’s wound.\n\n\n“Hands, hands!”\n\n\n[‘Gide( )’ falls into fear! All stats are reduced by 30%.]\n\n\n“Don’t be rude! I’ll be fine when I go back!”\n\n\n“Keep, turn it off!”\n\n\n“Bugs!”\n\n\nI kicked Gide.\n\n\n“Wake up, you will be! Are you going to keep up with us? The cut is left hand. Wielding the sword with your right hand!”\n\n\n“I’m sorry…”\n\n\n“Stop the bleeding as soon as possible and put things in order. If you don’t change, Hanson will die.”\n\n\n“yes yes!”\n\n\n“Jenna, return as soon as you confirm that the blood has stopped.”\n\n\n“Okay!”\n\n\nBefore you know it, three goblins who have climbed over the wall are wandering around in the clearing.\n\n\nI ran straight ahead and swung my sword long. The upper bodies of the two goblins swept away by the radius fell at an angle. The other hit the head with the edge of the shield.\n\n\nThe wall built by the corpse on the left is collapsing.\n\n\nThere were even those who climbed on corpses.\n\n\n“…”\n\n\nThere is no time to curse. I put my sword in the face of the goblin as it jumped into the clearing. The goblin was grilled on skewers just as it was running. On the other side, two goblins were climbing over the wall again.\n\n\nUnfavorable with a sword. The distance to run is too far. But it doesn’t stop. It’s even more of a headache the day they go to Aaron or Hanson. As he ran, he decapitated two of them. This time, three of them appeared in different places.\n\n\n“Are you done yet?”\n\n\n“It’s done!”\n\n\n“Kiaaaaa!”\n\n\nCorpses in the aisle to the left fell and goblins began pouring out.\n\n\n“I’m coming back. Take care of those guys!”\n\n\n“yes!”\n\n\nJenna jumped up and immediately pulled the protest. The three goblins collapsed side by side in a triple fire like lightning.\n\n\nCoincidentally, goblins who had penetrated the barricade were pushing out from the left.\n\n\n“Get back in, boys!”\n\n\nI kicked the goblin in front with all my might. The goblin tumbled and fell like dominoes with the guys behind it. He stabbed his sword without hesitation.\n\n\nToo much time was wasted covering the empty lot. On the contrary, the left side became the most dangerous. The goblin’s dagger leaked through the cracks in the corpse and scratched the elbow of the leather armor. If the dagger was just a little sharper, it would have cut through the bones. I cut off his wrist.\n\n\nIf someone gets up, kick them. do not allow progress Push with the shield and pierce the sword. I pierced one guy’s chest and pushed it as it was. The ranks of dozens of goblins were pushed back one after another.\n\n\n“I can’t hear the sword!”\n\n\nHanson let out an urgent cry.\n\n\n“Gide, can you change?”\n\n\n“Gwa, that’s okay! We can fight!”\n\n\n“Switch. Hanson, get out and examine the sword!”\n\n\n[14:35]\n\n\nHanson withdrew to the clearing and wiped the bloodstained blade with the sleeve of his clothes. The truth soon came out. Hanson let out a deep moan.\n\n\nThe days were running out. It was an expected result. It’s better than an F-grade old iron sword. But anyway, it was an ordinary iron sword.\n\n\nNeither do I. Due to the difference in performance, I was still safe, but I felt the blade getting stiff.\n\n\n“Even without a blade, I can beat a goblin!”\n\n\nI hit the goblin with my shield. The goblin with a broken neck drooped.\n\n\nAfter a moment of leisure, I looked around the vacant lot. Dozens of goblins are lying in the clearing. For the time being, there didn’t seem to be any intruders.\n\n\nAaron is also not well. The barricade collapsed long ago. Gradually the ranks were pushed back. The spear stabbing speed was noticeably slower than the first time. The signs of fatigue were clearly felt in the movement.\n\n\n“Jenna, switch with Aaron.”\n\n\n“yes!”\n\n\n“I’m still…”\n\n\n“I’m out!”\n\n\nJenna jumped in with a nimble body and cut the goblin’s throat.\n\n\nA fountain of blood gushed out. Jenna started swinging the dagger, not caring that her clothes were getting wet.\n\n\n“Rest when you can. Don’t be stubborn.”\n\n\n“Oh, I see…”\n\n\nAaron slumped against the wall in the clearing and caught his breath. The spear was stained with blood right up to the handle.\n\n\n[12:35]\n\n\n“Three minutes left, hold on for three minutes!”\n\n\nWas 30 minutes such a long time?\n\n\nNow gradually I felt tired too. But even I can’t afford to take a shift. I stabbed and stabbed the goblins that were pushed out again.\n\n\n“Aaron, switch with Jenna!”\n\n\nAaron jumped up, grabbed his spear, and ran to the right.\n\n\nAaron couldn’t even rest for a minute. Because the goblins started climbing the wall again. Jenna had to drop out to deal with the goblins in the clearing.\n\n\n“Stop coming up! Annoying!”\n\n\nJenna pulled the bowstring with a pickaxe. More than half of the arrows in the quiver are missing. They said they were recovering, but there were many arrows that were broken or damaged in the process of getting stuck.\n\n\n[11:22]\n\n\n“Whoops, whoops, whoops, whoops!”\n\n\nGide caught his breath. The snow had sunk.\n\n\n“Hanson, shift!”\n\n\n“yes yes!”\n\n\nHanson’s complexion, running while holding a sword and shield, is also not good.\n\n\n“Jenna, shoot the arrow at Hanson.”\n\n\n“Yes? But…”\n\n\nJenna cast her gaze at the quiver on her back.\n\n\nI know. that there is not much\n\n\n“Anyway, if there’s a hole in there, search all over. Throw a stone at the goblins!”\n\n\n“all right!”\n\n\nping!\n\n\nAn arrow pierced the goblin’s philtrum. The goblin with its philtrum pierced struggled forward. A knife was in his trembling hand.\n\n\nThe knife was lodged in Gide’s lower stomach as he was about to switch off with Hanson.\n\n\n“…!”\n\n\nGide’s pupils dilate.\n\n\nAn inexplicable moan escaped his open mouth.\n\n\ndump.\n\n\nGide fell face down.\n\n\nDark red blood gushed out from his abdomen.\n\n\n[‘Gide( )’ has fallen into a dying state. Life is in danger!]\n\n\nHe bit his lip.\n\n\nIt’s not an emergency situation. If any of the three of us fall out, the passage will open immediately.\n\n\nHanson swung his sword, not knowing that Gide behind him was dying.\n\n\nGide opened his mouth.\n\n\nBloody foam flowed out.\n\n\n“wait!”\n\n\nJenna rotated her body and fired four arrows in a row. The arrows hit the goblins crossing the wall from different directions.\n\n\nWith this, the arrows in the quiver ran out.\n\n\n[08:05]\n\n\nJenna ran to Gide.\n\n\nGide’s eyes are cloudy. You won’t even know what’s already in front of you.\n\n\n“shit!”\n\n\nAs the sword struck, the goblin’s skull split vertically.\n\n\n“Ah, ooh, uh, ah…”\n\n\nEven if there was time to do first aid, there was no way.\n\n\nPull out the knife stuck in that stomach? Immediately, blood gushed out like a fountain.\n\n\nI’m sure you know that there’s nothing I can do about it. Jenna lowered her head slowly, then stood up again and grabbed the bow.\n\n\n[‘Gide( )’ has returned to the arms of the goddess! His fighting spirit will be remembered forever.]\n\n\n“Gee, Gide, give me a second shift. 30 seconds is enough… Now, hold on.”\n\n\nHanson gasped and murmured.\n\n\nThere is no one who will listen to that.\n\n\nThe goblin stabbed the spear. I grabbed the window sill with my side and pulled it out. A long window stuck out. You’ve got a weapon you can use for a while. I grabbed the spear with both hands and stabbed it.\n\n\nThrough the first, through the second, through the third, fourth, sixth.\n\n\nHe gave strength to his whole body. The muscles in my ankles and calves were agitated.\n\n\npushed it straight A strong repulsive force returned. gritted it It tasted like blood. The goblins in the aisle were gradually pushed back.\n\n\nI squeezed my strength to the limit and thrust the handle of my long spear into the goblin’s chest.\n\n\n“Kueeaek!”\n\n\nAt least ten of them would have penetrated.\n\n\nThere was a momentary delay in the goblin’s advance.\n\n\nran straight into the clearing.\n\n\n“Hanson, go to the passage on the left! I’m in charge of this!”\n\n\n“Brother? Gide…”\n\n\n“He’s tired and he’s resting. Don’t talk nonsense and go.”\n\n\n“Oh, I see!”\n\n\nHanson gasped and ran to the left.\n\n\nIt seems that Gide’s corpse, which was at his feet, was never found. I blocked the road with a goblin skewer, so I can rest for 30 seconds to 1 minute.\n\n\nI swung the iron sword. Sticky blood and fat stretched out.\n\n\n[Heroes’ souls awaken in critical situations!]\n\n\n[Follow me!]\n\n\n[Skill Awakening!]\n\n\n[‘Han( )”s ‘Lesser Swordsmanship’ has risen to Lv.5!] [\n\n\n‘Han( )’s ‘Pain tolerance’ has risen to Lv.2!]\n\n\n[‘Han( )”s ‘calmness’ has been upgraded by two levels! It has risen to Lv.3.]\n\n\n[Follow me!]\n\n\n[Skill Awakening!]\n\n\n[‘Jenna( )”s ‘Lesser Daggersmanship’ has risen to Lv.3!] [\n\n\n‘Jenna( )’ has ‘Quick Movement’ I learned the skill!]\n\n\nIf you wake up and die after sleeping, it’s useless.\n\n\nI jumped right in.\n\n\nThe situation in this aisle is instantaneous. They couldn’t come out because they were stuck in a narrow alley, but as soon as their balance was broken, dozens or hundreds of goblins would fill the empty lot.\n\n\nHit the head of the goblin in the lead. I kicked my chest hard with my foot, but it didn’t push me. The goblins behind them were acting as cushions. Then die there. After being kicked several times, he vomited blood and died standing.\n\n\n[05:21]\n\n\nJenna ran across the clearing with a dagger.\n\n\nThe arrow fell long ago. The goblins tirelessly climbed over the wall, which was taller than a person.\n\n\n“Aagh!”\n\n\n[‘Hanson ( )’ is bleeding. Stamina decreases at regular intervals.]\n\n\nA scream was heard from the passage on the left.\n\n\nHanson’s right arm is covered in blood. It looked like it had been cut with a knife.\n\n\nbleeding profusely I couldn’t even cut it cleanly.\n\n\n‘… unable to fight.’\n\n\n“Gather in the clearing! Leave the aisle! Turn your back to the wall!”\n\n\nCurrently, there are four directions of goblin invasion.\n\n\nalleys on the lower right and left respectively. Lastly, it is the stone wall of the vacant lot.\n\n\nIt takes at least four people to stop it.\n\n\nThe remaining combatants are me, Jenna, and Aaron.\n\n\n“Brother, help me! Help me!”\n\n\nIf I go to the rescue, I will be in danger too.\n\n\nI headed to the clearing.\n\n\nImmediately, goblins began pouring in from the passageway below.\n\n\n“Where and where should we gather?”\n\n\nAaron’s behavior was a mess.\n\n\nThe original shape of the leather armor is unrecognizable, and the whole body is covered in blood. Mine won’t be any different either.\n\n\n“Jenna, Aaron, stick with me.”\n\n\n[‘Hanson ( )’ has returned to the arms of the goddess! His fighting spirit will be remembered forever.]\n\n\n“Geed and Hanson…”\n\n\n“If you’re going to mourn, do it after you’re alive!”\n\n\nThe road is open. Goblins poured out like ants in the clearing.\n\n\nJenna Aaron and I formed a square with our backs to the north wall. Aaron in the center, I am right, Jenna is left.\n\n\n“Are we going to die here?”\n\n\n“Fuck the bullshit.”\n",
