Mission Type Survival (4)\n\n\nThe corpses of Gide and Hanson are buried among the goblins and are nowhere to be seen.\n\n\nHundreds and thousands of pairs of red eyes are looking at us.\n\n\n“Jenna, can you see the wall behind your back?”\n\n\n“I see.”\n\n\n“Climb that wall.”\n\n\nA high wall against which we stand. Above it is the roof of the building. Jenna glanced behind her.\n\n\n“Then I’ll run away alone.”\n\n\n“Whoever wants it? If you climb, I will climb next. Next, Aaron. You go up first and extend your hand.”\n\n\n“all right.”\n\n\nAaron’s appearance is not words.\n\n\nI’m breathing heavily as if I don’t have time to speak.\n\n\n“Come! Aaron, hold your seat!”\n\n\n“I’ll go first!”\n\n\nJenna started climbing the stone wall.\n\n\n“Kiyaaaa!”\n\n\nDozens of goblins swarmed at once. I cut like a half circle. The goblins’ chests revealed their inner flesh. Aaron also swung the spear roughly.\n\n\n“Don’t use the sting! Not one at a time!”\n\n\nI blocked the sword attack with my shield and then struck.\n\n\nThe number of goblins he had to deal with at the same time increased dramatically. No country can block and avoid it. Scratches began to appear all over the place.\n\n\n“It’s all up! Come quickly!”\n\n\n“Goes!”\n\n\nI squeezed my strength and swung it long. The goblins were cut to pieces.\n\n\nAnd immediately I turned my back and climbed the stone wall. There is a gap where you can step on and climb up.\n\n\n[03:12]\n\n\n“Aaron, come up too!”\n\n\n“…”\n\n\n“Can’t you hear me!”\n\n\nAaron, who suddenly came to his senses, turned around.\n\n\n“Oh, I can’t hear you. Go, go, go!”\n\n\n“Hold your hand.”\n\n\nJenna held out her hand. I took that bloody hand and climbed up to the roof. Below was Aaron, who hurriedly climbed up.\n\n\n“Take my hand.”\n\n\nI put my hand on the roof.\n\n\nJust as Aaron was about to climb up holding his hand.\n\n\n“Ouch!”\n\n\nAaron groaned.\n\n\n“…”\n\n\nA knife stuck in Aaron’s calf.\n\n\nThe knife was deeply embedded in a crack in the wall.\n\n\n“I-I can’t…”\n\n\n“Jenna, I’m holding Aaron.”\n\n\nI grabbed the edge of the roof and went down the wall.\n\n\n“What are you trying to do?”\n\n\n“Cut off your foot. When you cut it, pull it up right away.”\n\n\n“…all right.”\n\n\nWhile holding the roof with his left hand, he swung the sword in his right hand vigorously.\n\n\nIt’s a posture that doesn’t work well, but you have to cut it at once. He remembered the feeling of cutting down a straw scarecrow with one blow.\n\n\n“Aaaagh!”\n\n\nOne of Aaron’s legs fell into the clearing, dripping with blood.\n\n\n“Pull it up!”\n\n\nJenna grabbed Aaron’s right hand with both hands and pulled him up.\n\n\nThe hot blood flowing from the severed leg soaked his face.\n\n\n“Two.”\n\n\nI spit out the blood that had entered my mouth and climbed back to the roof.\n\n\n[‘Aaron ( )’ is bleeding. Stamina decreases at regular intervals.]\n\n\nAaron slumped on the roof as if he had no strength to struggle.\n\n\nI looked down at the roof.\n\n\n“Ha, really.”\n\n\nCountless goblins gathered under the roof. The goblin looked up at us and squeaked.\n\n\n“Is it done?”\n\n\n“Do you think so?”\n\n\nA goblin fell down. Another goblin climbed on top of it and fell down. The goblins started building pyramids.\n\n\n“Wow, that’s smart.”\n\n\n“Smart ass!”\n\n\nThe goblin at the top was able to pick up a crack in the stone wall. The goblin who built the stairs like that gradually climbed up the wall.\n\n\nI checked the roof. The broken roof was littered with broken pieces of brick. I threw a brick at the goblins below.\n\n\n“Quek!”\n\n\nThe goblin, hit by a brick in the nose, fell.\n\n\n“Don’t let me come up!”\n\n\n“yes!”\n\n\n[01 : 58]\n\n\nAll the bricks were gone.\n\n\nNow goblins were coming up from all sides. Jenna held the dagger in reverse.\n\n\n[‘Aaron ( )’ has fallen into a dying state. Life is in danger!]\n\n\nAaron is hanging like a corpse.\n\n\nIt’s not dead, but it won’t be long. The bleeding was too much.\n\n\n“Use Aaron’s spear. Stab them as they come!”\n\n\nJenna grabbed the blade of the dagger with her index and middle fingers and threw it. The dagger stuck between the goblin’s forehead.\n\n\nPicking up the spear, Jenna began stabbing it downward. I also raised my sword and stabbed the goblins that came up.\n\n\nThe goblins at the top fell, taking the ones below as their companions. But there were more people coming up than people falling.\n\n\nIf you drop a goblin on one wall, the goblin on the other wall will come up, and if you go to that wall, it will come back up from the original wall.\n\n\n‘There’s no other place to run…’\n\n\nI looked around as I kicked the goblins who were trying to reach for the roof.\n\n\n‘damn.’\n\n\nThe other roofs are already occupied by goblins. They were glaring at us with their eyes shining bright red.\n\n\n“Kyaaaagh!”\n\n\n“What, did you get stabbed?!”\n\n\nI looked behind me hastily.\n\n\nIt would be difficult for Jenna to suffer here. I couldn’t close the slope on my own.\n\n\nJenna was holding onto her right arm.\n\n\nHe wasn’t hurt, but he didn’t have the spear he had with him.\n\n\n“I missed the window.”\n\n\n“I’m going to make the liver fall!”\n\n\n“Now what?”\n\n\n“What can I do? Kick it and drop it!”\n\n\nJenna kicked the goblin in the face, lying on the slope of the roof. The guy screamed and fell out.\n\n\n[ 01 : 24 ]\n\n\n“Ki-yi-i-i-yi-yi-i-yi!”\n\n\nDozens of hands waved under the wall and grabbed the sword. The green skin was cut and bleeding, but the goblins didn’t care and drew their swords.\n\n\n“Kuk!”\n\n\nWithout hesitation, I let go of the sword. It was swallowed up in waves of black goblins and disappeared.\n\n\nAll that was left was a shield that was dented and covered in blood.\n\n\nI placed my hand on the roof with the corner of the shield. The severed goblin’s fingers flew through the air, spraying blood.\n\n\n“Too, too many! How many are left? I can’t stand it any longer!”\n\n\n“30 seconds, only 30 seconds!”\n\n\n“It seems like an hour has passed!”\n\n\n“It’s true, just believe once and hold on a little longer!”\n\n\n[ 00 : 32 ]\n\n\nVision is blurry.\n\n\nHis right eye was covered in blood and he couldn’t see well.\n\n\nI can’t tell if it’s my blood or the goblin’s blood.\n\n\nThe body was asking for a break.\n\n\nstop resting now that you’ve had enough\n\n\ngrit it\n\n\nI was determined to become weak.\n\n\ncan’t die here I also have something called pride. On the 5th floor, still on the 5th floor!\n\n\nFinally one stepped onto the roof.\n\n\nHe slashed his head with the edge of his shield. As he fell, he swung his sword. His right arm was deeply cut. Blood spurted out.\n\n\n[‘Han( )’ is bleeding. Stamina decreases at regular intervals.]\n\n\nUnreasonable.\n\n\nI couldn’t understand why I had to go through high school in a place like this.\n\n\nThere was nothing like this on Earth. I slept in a warm place and ate a delicious meal.\n\n\nwhy me.\n\n\nwhy me!\n\n\n[스킬 각성!]\n\n\n[‘한( )’이 ‘광폭성’ 스킬을 습득했습니다!]\n\n\n“이 개새끼야!”\n\n\nI tossed my shield at the goblin who was just climbing up.\n\n\nA short scream came from the side.\n\n\n“Ugh!”\n\n\n[‘Jenna( )’ is suffering from bleeding. Stamina decreases for a certain period of time.]\n\n\n“Aren’t you dead yet?”\n\n\n“It’s okay, I can hold on.”\n\n\nA dagger is embedded in Jenna’s side.\n\n\nThe hem of the dress was dyed red.\n\n\nAaron is showing the whites. My body trembled. Blood gushed intermittently from the severed leg.\n\n\nIt wouldn’t be strange if he died at any time.\n\n\n“Don’t die! Just don’t die until the end! Then you can go back.”\n\n\n“I-I think I’ve come this far…”\n\n\n“Shut up!”\n\n\ncan’t stop anymore\n\n\nDozens of goblins climbed onto the roof at once.\n\n\n“Retreat, go inside the roof, go inside the roof.”\n\n\n“It’s inside and there’s no space!”\n\n\n“If you go, go!”\n\n\nI lost feeling in my right arm.\n\n\nThe world is spinning in circles, perhaps because of anemia.\n\n\n“Kerr, Kerrrrrrak!”\n\n\n“I want to kill me. Okay, come in, come in, baby!”\n\n\nNo sword or shield.\n\n\nYou can’t even recognize how many seconds are left.\n\n\nI can’t care what happened to Jenna.\n\n\n“Kiaaa!”\n\n\nDozens of goblins charged at the same time.\n\n\nThe blood-soaked blade tried to tear the whole body apart.\n\n\nand.\n\n\n[00:00]\n\n\nAs if time had stopped, the goblins stopped pointing their swords at me.\n\n\n[Stage clear!]\n\n\n[‘Han( )’ ‘Jenna( )’ ‘Aaron( )’ level up!]\n\n\n[Reward – 30000G Iron Ore (B) X 3 Leather (B) X 2 Plank (B) X 2]\n\n\n[MVP – ‘Han( )’]\n\n\n“…”\n\n\nThe scenery of the ruined city, numerous goblins, Gide and Hanson’s corpses disappear into the light.\n\n\nWhite light enveloped my whole body, repairing my wounds. My arms feel better, my lungs that are about to burst breathe again, and my torn muscles recover.\n\n\nThe dagger lodged in Jenna’s side fell of its own accord, and new flesh sprouted from Aaron’s severed leg.\n\n\n“Ah, ahahaha.”\n\n\nJenna sat down with a dejected smile.\n\n\n“Can you hold my hand? My leg is broken and I can’t get up.”\n\n\nI held out my hand without a word.\n\n\nJenna held her hand, stumbled several times, then got herself up.\n\n\n“Are we alive?”\n\n\n“…okay.”\n\n\nIt was a familiar room.\n\n\n[Climb the tower and save the world!]\n\n\n[Main Dungeon: Current number of floors to climb – 5]\n\n\nThe message on the left mirror announced clearing.\n\n\nKurur.\n\n\nThe waiting room started to rise with a familiar vibrating sound.\n\n\nAaron is lying on the floor of the space-time gap.\n\n\nHe seems unconscious, but is breathing regularly.\n\n\nThis guy also survived.\n\n\n“Is it like this from the 5th floor? If this is true…”\n\n\n“This time was unusual.”\n\n\nreviewed the battle.\n\n\nA passage divided into three parts. swarming goblins.\n\n\nIt was a structure in which annihilation was forced if even one person failed to do their part. If Gide and Hanson had been raised a little more, they wouldn’t have had to fight so desperately.\n\n\nSurvival missions are not that difficult once you have a party. It’s just that I was unlucky at this timing when I was most vulnerable.\n\n\nI picked up the iron sword and shield lying on the floor.\n\n\nThe bloody equipment was also neatly restored.\n\n\n“Ah, that’s really too much! If I had known it would be like this, I would have trained harder!”\n\n\nJenna sighed and hung the bow and quiver on her back.\n\n\nHis voice was bright, but his complexion was not.\n\n\nGide and Hanson are dead.\n\n\nI picked up the fallen Aaron.\n\n\nWhen I came out to the square, Dika came running as if I had been waiting.\n\n\n“Brother, thank you for your hard work!”\n\n\nI walked silently towards the inn.\n\n\n“Are Gide and Hansson in? I heard Chloe-sister prepared something delicious.”\n\n\n“Dead.”\n\n\n“Yes?”\n\n\n“Dead.”\n\n\nDeca stiffened while standing.\n\n\nI ignored it and went into the dorm.\n\n\nSome people in the lobby gave me their eyes. I saw Aaron in the lobby. Lay him down on the couch. Put the window next to him. The wound has healed, so he’ll come to his senses.\n\n\n[The master is calling. The person being called out!]\n\n\nI heard Isel’s screams in the square.\n\n\nIt looks like he’s trying to foster a sub-party from the lower floors.\n\n\n‘ My head hurts.’\n\n\nI don’t want to be sentimental because someone in the waiting room died.\n\n\nIn this place, moreover, death would be a daily routine for me, who runs the forefront of the tower. But I couldn’t help but feel a pounding in my head. Open the door at the far\n\n\nend of the hallway and enter. It was my room. Now I’m used to this place, which is not a modern house.\n\n\nI threw myself on the bed.\n\n\n[Congratulations Master! You have safely cleared the 5th floor. From now on, the daily dungeon will be open. Gather various materials to strengthen the waiting room and heroes. Try it.]\n\n\nAs I cleared the 5th floor, a message announcing the opening of the daily dungeon came to my mind.\n\n\n‘Speaking of which, did you get the Berserk skill…’\n\n\nCalmness and fury cannot coexist.\n\n\nIt was an obvious bug.\n\n\nDon’t lose your sanity under any circumstances. The rage that greatly increases combat power at the expense of\n\n\ncomposure and reason.\n\n\nIt must be related to my constitution, which seems to be a half-mix of a master and a hero.\n\n\nI don’t know yet. At least I didn’t want to think about it today.\n\n\nFrom tomorrow, I’ll be busy again.\n\n\n1 It was close to the castle’s limit of level 10, and the daily dungeon where materials could be obtained was also opened.Now it\nwas time\n\n\nto aim for a 2-star promotion .",
